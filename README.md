ECU definitions for BMW E36 318i created by ba114

This is the development repository for identifying new maps in the Bosch M5.2.1 DME utilised in the E36 318i.
This sub-repository will only be focussing on:

E38 740i M5.2 M62 V8
ECU: 0261203474


All contributions are welcome. Most maps are already known and i will periodically be adding more. The biggest help to this process would be anyone that is able to disassemble the code and identify the routine for EWS delete.
